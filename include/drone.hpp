/// @brief Represents a drone navigating through a terrain.

/// It tracks visited positions, counts visits, and uses heuristics (least visited, highest
/// information gain) to choose the next move. The drone aims to find a target without prior
/// knowledge of its location, avoiding obstacles and exploring efficiently.
